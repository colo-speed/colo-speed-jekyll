  - question: What is health research?
    answer: Health research is undertaken to learn more about human health and wellbeing. It includes improving our understanding about diseases, so that better ways to treat and prevent disease can be developed. Ultimately, health research aims to improve the care patients receive.  
  - question: What is a research study and why would I want to participate?
    answer: >
      A research study is the process of collecting and analysing information to answer a specific question and add to existing knowledge. Clinical research studies involve using information gathered from patients.  


      Research studies are essential in discovering new tests and treatments, helping us understand  which treatments are most effective for patients and in making sure that we use existing treatments in the best possible ways. Your participation in a research study may help  people who may be suffering from the same disease or condition to receive better treatment in the future.
  - question: How is my safety protected?
    answer: >
      All health research studies are strictly regulated to try to make them ethical and safe. There is a rigorous approval process for any research study prior to its commencement which includes approval by:  


      1. Independent scientific review (of the protocol)

      2. Health Research Authority

      3. Research Ethics Committee


      Additionally all members of staff involved in research have received mandatory training such as the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) course to ensure that research is conducted to a set standard which is safe and ethical. Additionally each research study is monitored and regulated by study teams, monitoring all study activity including any adverse events that may occur.
