    answer: >
      Patients and public have helped shape COLO-SPEED and will continue to be at the heart of the programme. Patients and public will also be involved in: prioritising research studies that will get access to COLO-SPEED; advising how studies can best take the patient perspective into account; identifying the research questions patients and public want to see answered; and spreading the message of research findings. 
      

      Patients attending endoscopy will be invited to: participate in colorectal research, either by directly entering a specific research study and/or consenting to be contacted in the future about suitable research studies. This unique resource will enable efficient delivery of cutting-edge research.
