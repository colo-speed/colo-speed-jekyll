    Why is this research important?

    <p>
      COLO-SPEED research is important because it aims to develop a practical application to save lives by stopping people dying from bowel cancer.  Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second most common cancer death in the UK. Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK each year and 16,000 people die from the disease (44 every day). Survival rates for those who are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK are lower than in many other developed countries, in part due to the fact that the cancer is more often diagnosed at a later stage here when treatment options are more limited.

      Most bowel cancer research focuses on treatment of more advanced bowel cancer.  COLO-SPEED aims to focus research on improving how we identify and diagnose patients most at risk of developing bowel cancer, and shift the balance towards prevention and earlier diagnosis to prevent unnecessary bowel cancer and death. This is what COLO-SPEED research seeks to do.
