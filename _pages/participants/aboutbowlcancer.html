      Bowel cancer, also called Colorectal Cancer (CRC), is the fourth most common cancer and the second most common cancer death in the UK. It is more common in older individuals, those with a family history of bowel cancer, or those with inflammatory bowel disease. In some individuals it may cause no symptoms, or may cause bleeding from the back passage, abdominal pain, change in bowel habit or weight loss. This is usually investigated with a camera which is inserted into the bowel through the back passage to examine the large bowel, otherwise known as a colonoscopy. For further information on a colonoscopy, please <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/colonoscopy">click here</a> (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/colonoscopy).
