  - question: How are participants recruited? 
    answer: Recruitment to an individual study happens with the research team at your local hospital. You will be given a patient information sheet which provides further details on the study such as information or any samples required for the study. You will then be given time to read through this and to decide if you want to participate in this study. Once you have decided to go ahead and participate in a study, the research team will go through the study and answer any further questions you have about the study. You will be asked to sign a consent form stating that you have understood the information and are freely choosing to take part in the study. 
  - question: What are the possible advantages and disadvantages of taking part? 
    answer: Since each study is unique, the possible advantages and disadvantages differ between studies. The research team will discuss any important study-specific information with you during the recruitment process. 
  - question: What is informed consent? 
    answer: Researchers are legally obligated to ensure participants are well-informed about the study before they agree to take part. All participants should receive a patient information sheet that explains the objectives of the research, possible risks and benefits they may experience, as well as contact details for a research team member for any future queries.  Participants will be asked to sign a consent form once they have fully understood the information in the patient information sheet and if they have decided to take part in the research study. You can change your mind and choose to withdraw from a research study at any time. Withdrawing from a research study will not affect the standard of care you receive. This is something you would need to address with your local research team.
