The COLO-DETECT trial, which closed to recruitment in March, has been in the spotlight! A number of local and UK-wide news organisations, including [BBC North](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-65336477), [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1762055/bowel-cancer-diagnosis-ai), [Sunday Sun](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/sunday-sun-1304/20230423/281633899543750) (in print), [Chronicle Live](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/health/ai-helps-detect-bowel-cancer-26751382), [Shields Gazette](https://www.shieldsgazette.com/health/ai-study-aimed-at-preventing-bowel-cancer-ends-at-south-tyneside-district-hospital-4111880), [Hull Daily](https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/pensioner-whose-bowel-cancer-found-8379365), [Wales Online](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/pensioner-whose-bowel-cancer-found-26763605), [ITVx](https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2023-04-20/uk-trial-underway-for-ai-device-which-could-cut-cancer-deaths) and [Newcastle World](https://www.newcastleworld.com/health/newcastle-university-led-research-uses-ai-to-detect-early-signs-of-bowel-cancer-4111938) have recently published articles on the trial and the exciting potential of artificial intelligence in improving colorectal cancer outcomes.  

COLO-DETECT is a randomised control trial evaluating whether colonoscopy assisted with the GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module improves the detection of abnormalities such as polyps and cancer compared to standard colonoscopy.

The GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module (from Medtronic Ltd.) is an artificial intelligence technology platform designed to assist the colonoscopist in the detection of abnormalities within the colon. The GI Genius™ connects to existing endoscopy systems and analyses real time images from the colonoscope camera live feed using artificial intelligence. The technology then highlights areas (with a green box) to the colonoscopist that would benefit from a more detailed inspection.

Articles covering COLO-DETECT have featured an interview with Jean Tyler, a COLO-DETECT participant, and COLO-DETECT Co-Chief Investigator, Prof Colin Rees (which is also available on [video](https://www.shieldsgazette.com/health/ai-study-aimed-at-preventing-bowel-cancer-ends-at-south-tyneside-district-hospital-4111880)). Mrs Tyler’s colonoscopy resulted in the identification of polyps and cancerous tissue by the GI Genius device. These abnormalities were surgically removed shortly thereafter, leaving her free of cancer.  Mrs Tyler’s experience demonstrates the potential benefits of artificial intelligence for the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer.
