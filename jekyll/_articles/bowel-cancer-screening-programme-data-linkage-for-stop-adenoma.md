All participants in the seAFOod Trial (see [Participant Summary of Results](https://colospeed.uk/assets/documents/seAFOod_Trial_participant_summary.pdf)) provided written informed consent for the STOP-ADENOMA team to obtain the results of future colonoscopy tests up to six years after their involvement in the trial. 

We will obtain the results of any colonoscopy undergone by seAFOod Trial participants from the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme database under the approval of the London-Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee and Public Health England Office for Data Release (ODR). 

How we will do this is explained in the [Privacy Notice](https://colospeed.uk/assets/documents/STOP-ADENOMA_PrivacyNotice.pdf) which explains how the study complies with the 2018 Data Protection Act, along with contact details for any queries.Â
