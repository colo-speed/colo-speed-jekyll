    title: "STSFT: COLO-COHORT study marks milestone with 1,000th patient recruited"
---
COLO-COHORT sponsor, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust (STSFT), recently reached a hugely impressive milestone by recruiting its 1000th participant into the study. 

This achievement was made possible through the highly successful collaborative relationship between the STSFT research delivery and endoscopy departments, who have worked together to deliver outstanding recruitment numbers into COLO-COHORT since the study launched in 2019. 

COLO-COHORT CI Professor Colin Rees said:
"I work with a fantastic team who are all committed to delivering high quality research to patients. 
"Iâ€™m hugely grateful to them and to the many patients who agree to be part of our research. 
"COLO-COHORT is a world leading study which we hope will make a huge difference to patients with bowel cancer and pre cancer."
