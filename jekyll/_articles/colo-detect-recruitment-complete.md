We are very pleased to announce that we have completed recruitment to the COLODETECT trial.

This is a brilliant achievement and we are very grateful to our sites for all of their hard work. We have run a number of large endoscopy trials and, set against the background of the pandemic, this has been without question the biggest challenge to date.

We are so grateful that our sites have persisted despite the obstacles and delivered one of the biggest colonoscopy trials of its type in the world. Above all we are grateful to the more than 2000 patients who agreed to participate in this trial.

We are now in the phase of completing all of the data and beginning analysis and we will provide further updates regarding results.
