The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) has featured Dr Laura Neilson in a masterclass [video](https://www.bsg.org.uk/videos/bsg-live-22-masterclasses/how-to-maximise-your-adenoma-detection-rate-during-colonoscopy/) on their website looking at the importance of lesion detection and adenoma detection rate (ADR) in the context of quality colonoscopy. In the video, Dr Neilson provides simple, evidence-based measures to maximise lesion detection rate and therefore improve colonoscopy quality, which is vital in ensuring relevant pathology is detected.

Dr Neilson is a Consultant Gastroenterologist at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, a clinical lecturer at Newcastle University and the co-chair of the Northern Region Endoscopy Group. She is actively involved in various COLO-SPEED studies, most notably leading the Newcastle ENDOPREM™ research, where she has developed the first endoscopy patient reported experience measure that is now being adapted for related procedures and is also used internationally.
