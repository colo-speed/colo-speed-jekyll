Newcastle University researchers in Gastroenterology and Hepatology are celebrating being ranked as top 10 in the latest US News Best Global Universities listing, conducted in collaboration with Clarivate. The league table recognises the international excellence of our research outputs, with Gastroenterology and Hepatology ranked no.1 in the world for both citation impact and the number of publications in the top-10% most cited. It also represents a third consecutive year-on-year rise in the global rankings for Gastroenterology and Hepatology research.

Colin Rees, Professor of Gastroenterology at Newcastle University, Consultant Gastroenterologist at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and Principle Investigator for COLO-SPEED, COLOCOHORT and COLODETECT said:

*‘This is brilliant news for Newcastle University, for South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS  Foundation Trust and for our colorectal cancer research.  This recognises the world leading nature of our research. Newcastle has a longstanding reputation in hepatology (liver disease) research but over the last decade we have grown the Gastroenterology side of the work with world leading research l in endoscopy and in screening, prevention and early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.'*

The Colorectal Cancer Screening Prevention Endoscopy and Early Diagnosis project (COLO-SPEED) launched in 2019 to recruit up to 5000 patients a year to help speed up research into the disease. The COLOCOHORT study, which has already recruited 3500 patients looking at risk factors for colorectal cancer, and the COLODETECT trial, which has recruited 1400 patients thus far, looking at whether artificial intelligence can improve detection at colonoscopy are examples of this excellent research. 

**About the rankings**

The US News Best Global Universities table began ranking American Universities in 1983 and expanded to include institutions around the world in 2014. The 2022-23 directory includes institutions from more than 90 countries.  It uses 13 indicators that measure academic research performance and global and regional reputations. It is designed to help students to explore the higher education options that exist beyond their own countries' borders and to compare key aspects of schools' research missions.
