Jennifer Smith, a COLO-COHORT participant who was recently recruited at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, has been featured in an NIHR Clinical Research Network North East and North Cumbria website [article](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flocal.nihr.ac.uk%2Fnews%2Fjennifer-smith-taking-part-in-research-doesnt-have-to-be-difficult%2F27725&data=04%7C01%7CNathania.Bestwick%40newcastle.ac.uk%7C7420c4dd602c42f80ed808d91ea8901e%7C9c5012c9b61644c2a91766814fbe3e87%7C1%7C0%7C637574531575513936%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2Fi4c2j5XUwUooN1O4Ps7UVFLnwJySrbodYEqRWzn74M%3D&reserved=0) in support of the [Be Part of Research](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7CNathania.Bestwick%40newcastle.ac.uk%7C7420c4dd602c42f80ed808d91ea8901e%7C9c5012c9b61644c2a91766814fbe3e87%7C1%7C0%7C637574531575523887%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=nyAp0aNWxjyDdfipVPy050KMylMUYd6hNUbow1b05WU%3D&reserved=0) campaign.

Jennifer described her experience of participating in COLO-COHORT as “quick and easy” and “an opportunity to do something good”. She also noted that the research team at South Tyneside District Hospital were “lovely and explained everything very carefully”, which is fantastic feedback to hear!

We would like to extend a big thank you to the dedicated research team at South Tyneside District Hospital, part of our sponsor South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, for their brilliant support with delivering the study and for making Jennifer’s experience so easy and straightforward.

We would also like to express our gratitude to Jennifer, and all our research participants, for the invaluable contribution that they make to our studies. As Professor Colin Rees says in the article, “without you we could not address these important research questions and improve the care for all patients”.
