Members of the COLO-SPIRIT research team recently attended the International Psycho-Oncology Society (IPOS) 2023 World Congress, from 31st August to 3rd September, in Milan. They presented the findings of their recently published systematic review on the burden of chronic bowel symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy, as well as a poster on their qualitative work looking at the ways in which these symptoms impact the daily activities of survivors.
