Following on from a record month for COLO-COHORT recruitment in October (with just under 400 participants recruited into the study) COLO-COHORT has officially marked its next major milestone of 6000 patients! With the 5000-patient milestone having been reached at the end of August, it has taken less than 3 months for us to recruit the next 1000 participants, demonstrating exceptional recruitment from our sites.

The particularly outstanding recruitment seen over the autumn has been due to existing sites posting impressive recruitment figures, while there have also been a number of new sites that have hit the ground running with remarkable recruitment from the get-go.

A message from Prof Colin Rees, COLO-COHORT Co-Chief Investigator:

*COLO-COHORT recruitment is at a record high, with last month being our most successful month to date. Additionally, with our previous major milestone of 5000 patients recruited into COLO-COHORT having taken place at the end of August, the next 1000 participants have been recruited into the study in less than 3 months.*

*We would like to express a huge thank you to our COLO-COHORT participants for agreeing to get involved with this research, Parabola and Guts UK for funding COLO-COHORT, and our brilliant sites for their consistent dedication and diligence in making this the world-class study that it is!*
