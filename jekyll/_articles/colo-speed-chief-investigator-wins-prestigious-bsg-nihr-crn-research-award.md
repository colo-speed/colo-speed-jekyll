---
COLO-SPEED Chief Investigator, Prof. Colin Rees, has been announced as the winner of the prestigious British Society of Gastroenterologists (BSG) and National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) research award for his ground-breaking work building COLO-SPEED, the world’s largest research platform for the prevention and early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.  

The BSG/CRN award recognises research leaders who demonstrate excellence and expertise in leading, designing and developing complex research projects, leading trials that have changed practice, finding new ways to engage with patients and nurturing and developing the early careers of fellow researchers working in the field.  

Prof. Rees has received this prestigious award in his capacity as a Chief Investigator who has made an outstanding contribution to the design, conduct and dissemination of gastroenterology research, as well as building research capacity.  

Dr Christina Dobson, COLO-SPEED Programme Manager, has congratulated Prof. Rees on winning this distinguished award. 

“We are thrilled that Prof. Rees’s longstanding contribution to the research field has led to him being awarded the first ever BSG/NIHR CRN award for the Principal Investigator making an outstanding contribution in design, conduct and dissemination of research, as well as building research capacity," she said. 

"His commitment to improving patients’ diagnostic pathways and outcomes, coupled with his vision and drive to develop an innovative and responsive approach to colorectal cancer research design and delivery, are truly exemplary. Many congratulations on this well-deserved award.” 

The BSG/NIHR CRN research awards will be presented at the next BSG Annual conference later in 2021.
