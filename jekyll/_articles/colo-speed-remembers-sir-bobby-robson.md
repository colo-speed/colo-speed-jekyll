This week COLO-SPEED joins the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, along with the wider football community, in the *Bobby ’90* birthday tribute. *Bobby ‘90* celebrates the life and legacy of Newcastle United football legend Sir Bobby Robson, who would have been 90 on Saturday.

COLO-SPEED Co-Chief Investigator (and avid Newcastle United supporter), Professor Colin Rees, says:

“*COLO-SPEED are absolutely delighted to celebrate the memory of the late great Sir Bobby Robson who would have been 90 this week. Sir Bobby was an inspirational figure in the North East, particularly to those with a passion for football, and his legacy lives on through the incredible work of The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. The Foundation have provided hugely generous funding to support our work in reducing deaths from bowel cancer and through this support we are continuing to deliver world leading research. Our team are made up of Newcastle and Sunderland fans and we are united in honouring and remembering Sir Bobby’s memory and his ongoing legacy by striving to improve outcomes for patients with bowel cancer*.”

For anyone interested in supporting the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation’s *Bobby ’90* tribute, a 40-page fanzine can be bought [online](https://bobby90.bigcartel.com/product/bobby-90-limited-edition-fanzine), with all proceeds going to the foundation.
