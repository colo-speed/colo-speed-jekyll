Work led by South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust in collaboration with Newcastle University has delivered the world's first fully patient derived Experience Measure for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. 

Previous measures have focused on what clinicians think matters to patients but the [Newcastle ENDOPREM](https://bmjopengastro.bmj.com/content/8/1/e000653)™ measures patient experience based upon what patients have told us matters to them. 

This is ground-breaking work and the Newcastle ENDOPREM™ is now being used extensively around the UK and by some of the leading centres in the world internationally. 

We believe this tool will become the standard internationally for how patient experience of endoscopy is measured.
