    title: Plasma and rectal mucosal oxylipin levels during aspirin and
      eicosapentaenoic acid treatment in the seAFOod polyp prevention trial
study: stop-adenoma

A [paper](https://colospeed.uk/assets/documents/STOP-ADENOMA%20oxylipins%20paper%20PLEFA%202023.pdf) from our STOP-ADENOMA study (which follows on from a completed clinical trial called seAFOod) has been published in the Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids journal. 

Below is a summary of the paper (which can also be viewed [online](https://colospeed.uk/assets/documents/STOP-ADENOMA%20oxylipins%20paper%20PLEFA%202023.pdf)):

Some researchers have suggested that substances called resolvins and lipoxins, which are derived from naturally-occurring fats in the body, might explain how aspirin and the omega-3 EPA reduce bowel cancer risk. In this study, we analysed blood and bowel wall samples from individuals who took part in the seAFOod trial, during which aspirin and EPA was prescribed for 12 months. We did not detect resolvin E or aspirin-triggered lipoxin in any of the samples that were tested. This is the longest study that tested for these substances. The results do not support the idea that resolvins or lipoxins are important for the anti-cancer activity of aspirin or EPA.
