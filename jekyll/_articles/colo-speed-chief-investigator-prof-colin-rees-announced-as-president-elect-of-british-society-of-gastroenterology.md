We are thrilled to announce that Prof. Colin Rees has been appointed as the new President Elect of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). His term is set to run for two years until July 2024, after which he will move into the role of BSG President until 2026.

Prof. Rees is a Professor of Gastroenterology and Consultant Gastroenterologist at Newcastle University and an Honorary Consultant at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust. He is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator and a leading expert in endoscopy and colorectal cancer (CRC) research. Prof. Rees has delivered a range of endoscopy and colorectal cancer studies, recruiting over 15,000 patients and leading some of the world’s largest endoscopy trials in his career to date. His research interests in endoscopy and colorectal cancer screening, prevention and early diagnosis, led him to develop COLO-SPEED and lead a diverse programme of associated studies.

The BSG is one of the world’s leading gastroenterology organisations with clinical standards, research and education as its core roles. It has around 4000 members and the BSG journal, Gut, is the world leading gastroenterology journal (Impact Factor 33). The BSG produces internationally leading guidelines and annually runs one of the largest GI meetings in Europe with over 2000 delegates. Professor Rees was BSG Vice President from 2015-17 and also established the BSG Endoscopy Quality Improvement Programme (EQIP).

We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to Professor Rees on this huge achievement and wish him all the best in his role as President Elect of the British Society of Gastroenterology.
