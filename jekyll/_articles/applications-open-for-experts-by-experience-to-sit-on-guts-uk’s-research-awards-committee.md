Guts UK are looking to appoint three volunteer Experts by Experience to sit on their Research Awards Committee. Experts by Experience (EBEs) are people who are living with a digestive disease, or those that care for someone with a digestive disease. The Guts UK Research Awards Committee (RAC) consists of a group of scientific expert advisors who review research applications and decide which research Guts UK should fund.

EBEs will work alongside the RAC to ensure that funded research applications will be of benefit to the patient community. EBE’s will assist the RAC by assessing which projects they believe are likely to benefit people with digestive conditions and writing summaries of research projects that are accessible to all, particularly members of the public. 

This voluntary role will consist of a 3-year commitment with a minimum of 2 meetings a year. The total time commitment is estimated to be around 30 hours per year. EBE’s will be asked to read some documents prior to meetings, the first of which takes place on 11th November 2021.

Guts UK will help EBEs in their role by providing an induction and training meeting, providing EBEs with all paperwork for review well in advance of meetings, paying for reasonable travel, overnight and subsistence expenses and making themselves available to answer any questions EBEs may have along the way.

For more information, or to apply for this role, please visit the Guts UK [website](https://gutscharity.org.uk/2021/09/we-need-you-to-shape-our-research/).
