    title: ITV Tyne Tees News Report
---
Prof Colin Rees, COLO-SPEED Co-Chief investigator, was interviewed last month for an ITV Tyne Tees news report about bowel cancer in the North East. In the interview, he highlighted the importance of ongoing research, screening and early diagnosis for improving bowel cancer outcomes in the region.


He said, "The North East has poor outcomes for bowel cancer. It has higher incidence rates than any other part of the country, and unfortunately the outcomes in the North East are worse than any other part of the country.


"So itâ€™s a really important area for us to target in the North East, for people to present for screening, present early if they have symptoms, and for us to collectively work to improve the outcomes from bowel cancer."
