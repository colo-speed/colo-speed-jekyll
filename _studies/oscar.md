Obesity has been shown to be associated with colorectal adenomas (pre-cancerous polyps). Non-alcohol Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has been shown in Eastern Asian countries to also be associated with colorectal adenomas.  In this study, we aim to assess the association between obesity and NAFLD with colorectal adenoma in a UK population. Information gathered in this study includes patient's medical history, medication history, family history, lifestyle (smoking and alcohol consumption habits), as well as height/ weight/ waist circumference measurements. We aim to tease out the association between obesity, NAFLD and colorectal adenomas, and to develop a risk model based on these factors to predict the presence of colorectal adenomas.
