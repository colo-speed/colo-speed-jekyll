This is a 3 year study, and will recruit a total of 1000 patients who are being treated for colorectal polyps, bowel cancer and healthy control individuals. From these patients, a stool sample will be collected as well as a health questionnaire including health problems, family history, dietary habit, and bowel habit. Colonoscopy and histology information will also be recorded.
