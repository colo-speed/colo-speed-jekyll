shortoverview: COLO-COHORT aims to develop a “risk stratification tool” to help
  determine which patients are at highest risk of having polyps or cancer; this
  tool will be able to be used in the future to work out which patients need to
  be referred to endoscopy for investigation.
aim: COLO-COHORT aims to develop a “risk stratification tool” to help identify
  which patients are at highest risk of having adenomas or bowel cancer. We will
  also explore the significance of the gut bacteria composition in patients with
  adenomas or cancer to help inform this risk model. Additionally we will
  develop a large platform of patients who consent to be contacted for future
  research.

COLO-COHORT, which is funded with a £1.25 million Guts UK Parabola Foundation grant, aims to recruit 10000 patients undergoing colonoscopy as part of ​the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP​) or due to symptoms. Participants will be asked to fill in a health questionnaire and have their height, weight and waist circumference measured. They will also receive blood tests and stool tests, depending on the indication for their colonoscopy. The results of the colonoscopy and any samples taken will be collated. Patients will receive a patient experience questionnaire or food frequency questionnaire.
