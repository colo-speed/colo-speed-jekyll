aim: COLO-COHORT aims to develop a risk tool to help identify which patients are
  at highest risk of having adenomas or bowel cancer. We will also explore the
  significance of the gut bacteria composition in patients with adenomas or
  cancer to help inform this risk model. Additionally we will develop a large
  platform of patients who consent to be contacted for future research.

shortoverview: COLO-COHORT aims to develop a “risk stratification tool” to help
  determine which patients are at highest risk of having polyps or cancer; this
  tool will be able to be used in the future to work out which patients need to
  be referred to endoscopy for investigation.
patientinfo: This study will be rolled out to sites within the North East by
  Spring 2020.  If you are interested in participating in this study, and if the
  study is open at your local hospital, please contact a member of your local
  research team.

COLOCOHORT is funded with a £1.25 million Guts UK Parabola foundation grant. We aim to recruit 10000 patients undergoing colonoscopy as part of BCSP or due to symptoms. Participants will be asked to fill in a health questionnaire and have their height, weight and waist circumference measured. They will also receive blood tests and stool tests, depending on the indication for their colonoscopy. The results of the colonoscopy and any samples taken will be collated. Patients will receive a patient experience questionnaire or food frequency questionnaire.

Additionally 10000 patients from the North of England will also be consented to be contacted for future studies with some of the information above collected.
