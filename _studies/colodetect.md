COLODETECT is a randomised control trial that will evaluate whether colonoscopy assisted with the GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module improves the detection of abnormalities such as polyps and cancer compared to standard colonoscopy. 

The GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module (Medtronic Ltd.) is an artificial intelligence technology platform designed to assist the colonoscopist in the detection of abnormalities within the colon. The GI Genius™ connects to existing endoscopy systems and analyses real time images from the colonoscope camera live feed using artificial intelligence. The technology then highlights areas (with a green box) to the colonoscopist that would benefit from a more detailed inspection.

The study will be undertaken in Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, surveillance, and symptomatic patient populations across 8 sites.

Participants will be randomised to receive either GI Genius™ assisted colonoscopy or standard colonoscopy. The results of the colonoscopies will be recorded and analysed to evaluate the effect of the GI Genius™ in the detection of abnormalities such as polyps and cancers.

This study will be led by Newcastle University and South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust working with North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in Health Clinical Trials Unit.
