  - name: John Whelpton
    affiliation: Patient and Public Involvement Lead
    # bio: Having survived my Bowel cancer in 2009, my Ileostomy was reversed in 2010, leaving me to live my “new normal” life. The support I received from Bowel Cancer UK during this time led me to volunteer for them as an Awareness Talk giver, and subsequently a member of their Research Network. I am a Research Champion within NIHR and Mid Yorks NHS Trust, as well as being a member of their Cancer Partnership Group. I now serve as a Co-Applicant, or Steering Group member, on several trials and studies, as well as running our local Support Group for Colorectal and Urology patients. Working with Macmillan Engagement Leads and a team of fellow Cancer survivors, we have recently finished writing and filming 2 educational videos to promote PPI.
